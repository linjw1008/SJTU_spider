Topic: Innovation and the future economy – latest research trends from the US


Innovation is critical to personal and national economic success. However, the changing nature of innovation is driving changes to the basis of competitive advantage for individuals, companies and states. As a result, many of today’s well paid professions and industries may disappear over the next ten years as they are displaced by the increasingly intelligent digital technologies which exemplify the so-called ‘Second Machine Age’. Steve will draw on some of the latest research from MIT and elsewhere to discuss the potential impact of developments in areas such as data science, synthetic biology, manufacturing, advanced materials, autonomics, communications, security, AI and robotics. He will also discuss the changing landscape of innovation and some of the resulting strategic challenges and opportunities.
